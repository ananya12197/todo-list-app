# Simple To-Do List App

This is a beginner-friendly To-Do List app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It lets me add tasks and display them dynamically.

### Features:
- Add new tasks by typing and clicking "Add"
- Tasks appear instantly in the list

### What I learned:
- Basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Handling user input dynamically
- Separating HTML, CSS, and JS in files

Building this app taught me how interactive JavaScript can be, and Iâ€™m excited to add more features soon!
